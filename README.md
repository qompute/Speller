# Speller
An iOS game that prompts users to spell a given word.

## Description
This was an early project inspired by the [Scripps National Spelling Bee](http://spellingbee.com/) competition. It simulates the competition by prompting users with a spoken word, its part of speech, its definition, and its country of origin. The player can then attempt to spell the word, and the app keeps track of the number of words the player has spelled correctly.

The app uses the [iOS speech synthesis API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avspeechsynthesizer) to say words and definitions out loud.
